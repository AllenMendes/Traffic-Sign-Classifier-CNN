# Traffic Sign Classifier Neural Network

Overview
---
To create a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify traffic signs based on the traffic sign images in the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). 

This CNN is based on the inception block concept and uses a multi-layered form of architecture to achieve  **96.6 % accuracy**. The entire CNN was trained on a **Amazon AWS EC2 cloud instance with a batch size of 75 and 150 epochs over a augmented training dataset of 41352 images** to classify into 43 different signs/classes.
